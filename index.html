<p style="font-size: larger;"><b>Background Information</b></p>
<p>Every now and then I revisit Bentham's philosophy of happiness and in doing so I help myself remember the importance of having two scales through which I can maximise my internal happiness; (i) scale of pleasure, where the focus is primarily to maximise pleasure; (ii) scale of pain, where the focus is to feel the least of this personal feeling. 'Happiness is a matter of experiencing pleasure and lack of pain', says Bentham Jeremy. This is my roadmap to happiness. You should be asking yourself why do I neccesarily have to tell you this?

<p>The answer is simple, I have to be brutally honest about my non-negotiables so that you immediately know how to treat or work in any way with me.</p>
<p>My non-negotiables are pretty simple: (i)Peace, (ii) Happiness, (iii)Life Purpose. It gets even simpler because in this page I also define what these terms mean to me.</p>
<p> The importance for the public to know this is so that I am able to network with everyone seamlessly, having laid down my belief system in a way that helps just about everyone to contextualise before judging my behaviour.</p>
<p>The following outlines the definition of peace in my viewpoint:</p>

<ul class="PHPdef">
  <li class="peace"><p><strong>PEACE</strong></p> <p>Peace in my own dictionary means the synchronised state in mind-soul-spirit system.</p></li>
  <li class="happiness"><p><strong>HAPPINESS</strong></p><p>Happiness is a function of pain reduction and pleasure optimisation.</p></li>
  <li class="purpose"><p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p><p>The process of naturally giving and receiving love. This can be easily observed from the <b>wu wei</b> state in <b>Taoism</b></p></li>

<hr class="hr_line" style="width: 300px;">
</div>

<p>As we grow it becomes hard to pinpoint or to understand our professional values until we encounter a professional environment and I am not immune to this challenge in self-discovery. I think these professional values grow with us as we thrive our way in life with the external environment that hugely shape who we are. A perfect example of this is when I noticed just how I am amazed by the whole idea of prosperity in living things. From plants, animals to other living things everything has a strong desire to witness the future either through offsprings or through any other possible way. This gave me strong instincts in making me want to be part of that global agenda for living things, i.e. outsurviving the stumbling blocks in our evolution through prosperity or fruition of progress.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I became part of an emerging non profit company whose main objective is to regulate the small business environment. In this company there are four main pillars or values that guide the operations of the company. These values echo a very good abstraction of my professional profile; it is them that make the working environment of this company, Small Business Practitioners of South Africa, conducive even for a professional like me. The following elaborates more on these values:</p>

<div class="profile_grid">
  <!-- This is for prosperity-->
  <div class="item">
    <img src="prosperity.png" alt="prosperity" height="100" width="100" style="float: center;">
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>PROSPERITY</b></p> 
    <p>"Anyone with the grit mindset that can last for a long time is simply regarded as prosperous for our purposes. This is because grit mindset guarantees the success we want to see in small business owners". This is how prosperity is defined in this company and that perfectly matches to what I mean when I say I value prosperity.</p>
  </div>

  <!--This part is for professionalism-->
  <div class="item">  <img src="professionalism.png" alt="Professionalism" width="100" height="100" style="float: center;">
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>PROFESSIONALISM</b></p>  
    <p>"For our purposes, professionalism shall mean the quality of being skillful or competent, responsible and punctual". This is how the company defines professionalism and I beg not to differ.</p>
  </div>

   <!--This part is for Integrity-->
    <div class="item">
    <img src="integrity.png" alt="integrity" width="140" height="100" style="float: center;"> 
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>INTEGRITY</b></p> 
    <p>In addition to being the quality of being honest and moral, integrity shall include being transparent, accountable, and time cautious. In this form, integrity is an integral part of my foundational professional values.</p>
  </div>
   <!--This part is for Knowledge-->
  <div class="item">  
  <img src="knowledge.png" alt="knowledge" width="100" height="100" style="float: center;">
  <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>KNOWLEDGE</b></p> 
  <p>In information systems studies knowledge shall mean an integrated and organised information acquired both from practical experience and non-practical studies. I want to say I have this viewpoint when I say knowledge is one of my fundamental professional qualities.</p>
